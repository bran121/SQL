# In this project, I worked with data from a digital media store including table information about artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers


# Here I look for customers that are not located within the United States
SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country != "USA";

# Here I am finding the invoices of customers who are from the United States using a JOIN clause 
SELECT cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.invoiceid, inv.billingcountry, inv.invoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
on inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "USA";

# I am finding a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent using 2 JOIN clauses
# The 2 JOIN clauses connect the the employees table with the customers table and the invoices table
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees as emp
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
    ON cust.SupportRepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
    ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
    
# This query finds the total sales made in 2009
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

# This query finds the number of invoices made in 2009
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate
BETWEEN "2009-01-01" AND "2009-12-31";
