# I downloaded Spotify Data consisting of their current Top 50 Songs from Kaggle.
# I then created the Table "Spotifydata" where I was able to insert this data.
# Lastly, I was able to perform analytics on the data using SQL.

# How I created the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Once I inserted the cvs file containing the Spotify Song Data, I was able to start analyzing the data using SQL.

# I decided to find out what the top 10 songs are based off their popularity rating 
# I found that Olivia Rodrigo seems to be quite popular
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Then I decided to find out how which artists had a song with a key over 5 as well as how many of those songs they had in the top 50
SELECT COUNT(artist_name), artist_name, track_name, key
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE key > 5
GROUP BY artist_name
;
